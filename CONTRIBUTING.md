# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

## Writing code
Check out the roadmap
We have some functionalities in mind and we have issued them and there is a milestone label available on the issue. If there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the issues page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it! Although it's better to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no confilcting code.

## Documentation
Every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented.
